# MacVulkan

The MacVulkan library is identical to GPUVulkan library, its just packaged to allow use with the MacOS platform.

Ideally this library should be consolidated with the GPUVulkan library provided we find a way for the MacVulkanApp to call the GPU Vulkan library directly.

This MacVulkanApp is on its own optimized version .Net, which is the hangup with using the GPUVulkan library directly. 

See GPUVulkan for more information.
